# Let's Get Personal 
I grew up too smart for my own good. Aceing external exams throughout highschool to dropping out of Engineering school, working as a server at a restaurant, and then joining an Esport team. My journey taught me that discipline, for me, was a state that required external pressure to induce. Alas, I picked up a degree, learnt how to code, and now I can say that I'm able to fully ~~bring~~ keep myself to the table.
