# Let's Get Personal 
I grew up too smart for my own good; aceing externals throughout highschool to dropping out of engineering school, working as a manager at a restaurant, and then becoming a professional Dota 2 player. 
My journey taught me that discipline, for me, was a state of mind that required external pressures to induce. 
So here we are, I picked up a degree, learnt how to code, and now I can say that I'm finally able to fully ~~bring~~ keep myself at the table.
